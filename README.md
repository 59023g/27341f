Context: 

An attempt to get my Dad to have his retirement less tied-up in the current equities market. Aims to demonstrate value of pre-crash sell and hold position using Debian, Docker, NodeJS, Express, Browserify, React, and D3. Also to see if the new hip (React) is actually the right new hip.

I am calling Yahoo's finance API for the data. And transforming it to my needs. 

To Start:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
